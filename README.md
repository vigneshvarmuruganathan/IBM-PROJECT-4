## Introduction

Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique that helps identify relationships between items that customers purchase together. It is widely used in retail and e-commerce to understand customer buying patterns and to improve sales and marketing strategies. This repository provides a simple implementation of Market Basket Analysis in Python, which you can use to analyze transaction data and uncover associations between products.

## Getting Started

To get started with Market Basket Analysis, follow the steps below.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/market-basket-analysis.git
```

2. Change the directory to the project folder:

```bash
cd market-basket-analysis
```

## Usage

The primary script for Market Basket Analysis is `market_basket_analysis.py`. You can use this script to analyze transaction data. 

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python market_basket_analysis.py --input input_data.csv --output output_data.csv
```

- Replace `input_data.csv` with the path to your transaction data file.
- Replace `output_data.csv` with the path where you want to save the results.

The script will generate association rules and save them in the output CSV file. You can customize the parameters and rule generation methods in the script as needed.

## Example

To illustrate how to use this Market Basket Analysis tool, consider a simple example:

1. Create a CSV file named `transactions.csv` with transaction data. Each row should represent a transaction, and the columns should contain the items purchased.

   Example `transactions.csv`:

   ```
   TransactionID,Items
   1,apple,banana,cherry
   2,apple,banana
   3,apple,cherry
   4,banana,cherry
   5,banana
   ```

2. Run the Market Basket Analysis script:

```bash
python market_basket_analysis.py --input transactions.csv --output association_rules.csv
```

3. The script will generate association rules and save them in the `association_rules.csv` file, indicating which items are frequently purchased together.
